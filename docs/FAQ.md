### How do credits (tokens) work?

**Understanding the Credit System:**

**What are Credits/Tokens?**
Credits (also called tokens) are the currency used to power AI analyses on YoForex AI. Think of them like mobile data - each AI analysis consumes a certain amount of tokens based on complexity.

**Monthly Allocation:**
- **Free Plan**: 1,000,000 tokens/month
- **Pro Plan**: 10,000,000 tokens/month  
- **Max Plan**: 50,000,000 tokens/month

**Token Consumption:**

| Action | Approximate Tokens |
|--------|-------------------|
| Basic Single AI Analysis | ~10,000 tokens |
| Premium Single AI Analysis | ~25,000 tokens |
| Multi-AI Analysis (2 models) | ~20,000 tokens |
| Multi-AI Analysis (5 models) | ~50,000 tokens |
| AI Chat Message | ~1,000-5,000 tokens |
| Image Analysis (Pro/Max) | ~15,000 tokens |

**How Many Analyses Can I Run?**

**Free Plan (1M tokens):**
- ~100 basic analyses
- ~40 premium analyses
- ~20 multi-AI analyses (5 models)

**Pro Plan (10M tokens):**
- ~1,000 basic analyses

**Credit Reset:**

- ✅ Starts at midnight UTC
- ❌ Unused credits do NOT carry over to next month
- ✅ Upgrade mid-month? Get full allocation immediately

**Monitoring Credits:**
- View remaining credits in dashboard (top-right)
- Real-time updates after each analysis
- Email alert at 80% usage
- Warning notification at 90% usage
- Analysis blocked at 100% usage

**Running Out of Credits?**

Options:
1. **Upgrade Plan**: Get instant access to more tokens
2. **Wait for Reset**: Credits reset 1st of month
3. **Use Wisely**: Save premium models for important trades
4. **Purchase Top-up**: (Feature coming soon)

**Tips to Maximize Credits:**
- Use basic models for quick market checks
- Reserve premium models for high-stakes trades
- Run single AI first, use multi-AI to confirm
- Avoid repeated analyses on same pair/timeframe
- Use longer timeframes (consume fewer tokens)

**Do Credits Expire?**
Yes, credits reset monthly and unused credits do not carry over. This encourages active trading and ensures you're getting value from your subscription.

## Trading & Analysis

### How accurate are the AI predictions?

**Honest Answer: AI is a powerful tool, but not a crystal ball.**

**Accuracy Metrics:**

Based on our internal testing and user feedback:
- **Overall Accuracy**: 65-75% across all strategies and timeframes
- **High Confidence Signals (>80%)**: 70-80% accuracy
- **Multi-AI Consensus**: 72-78% accuracy (higher than single AI)
- **Best Performing Strategies**: ICT Concept (76%), SMC (74%), Fibonacci (72%)
- **Best Timeframes**: H4 and D1 (higher accuracy than M1/M5)

**Factors Affecting Accuracy:**
- ✅ Market conditions (trending vs ranging)
- ✅ Timeframe (longer = more reliable)
- ✅ Strategy selected (some work better in certain markets)
- ✅ AI confidence score (>70% = better accuracy)
- ✅ Multi-AI consensus (reduces false signals)
- ❌ High-impact news events (unpredictable)
- ❌ Low liquidity periods (slippage and gaps)
- ❌ Flash crashes and black swan events

**Important Disclaimers:**

⚠️ **No trading system is 100% accurate**
⚠️ **Past performance doesn't guarantee future results**
⚠️ **AI analysis is for informational purposes only**
⚠️ **You are responsible for your trading decisions**
⚠️ **Always use proper risk management**

**How to Improve Your Success Rate:**

1. **Follow AI Confidence Scores**: Only trade signals >70% confidence
2. **Use Multi-AI Consensus**: Higher agreement = better accuracy
3. **Combine Timeframes**: Confirm signals across multiple timeframes
4. **Proper Risk Management**: Never risk >2% per trade
5. **Avoid News Events**: Don't trade during high-impact news
6. **Use Stop Losses**: Always protect your capital
7. **Track Performance**: Learn which strategies work best for you

**Reality Check:**
Professional traders typically aim for 55-65% win rate with proper risk management. Our AI gives you an edge, but YOU must manage risk and make final decisions.

**Not Financial Advice:**
YoForex AI provides analysis and educational tools. We are not financial advisors. Always do your own research and trade responsibly.

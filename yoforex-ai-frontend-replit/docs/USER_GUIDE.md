## Managing Active Trades

### Viewing Active Positions

**Access Your Open Trades:**

1. Click "Active Trades" in the navigation menu
2. Or click "View Active Trades" quick action on dashboard

**Active Trades Display:**

Each trade card shows:
- **Pair**: Currency pair being traded
- **Direction**: BUY (green) or SELL (red)
- **Entry Price**: Your entry point
- **Current Price**: Live market price
- **Stop Loss**: Current SL level
- **Take Profit**: Current TP level
- **P&L**: Current profit/loss ($ and %)
- **Status**: Open, Pending, or Partially Closed
- **Duration**: Time since trade opened

**Color Coding:**
- Green: Profitable position
- Red: Losing position
- Gray: Break-even

### Understanding P&L Calculations

**How Profit/Loss is Calculated:**

```
P&L = (Current Price - Entry Price) × Position Size × Pip Value

For BUY positions:
Profit when Current Price > Entry Price

For SELL positions:
Profit when Current Price < Entry Price
```

**Example:**
```
Entry: EUR/USD BUY at 1.0850
Current Price: 1.0870
Position Size: 1 standard lot (100,000 units)
Pip Value: $10

P&L = (1.0870 - 1.0850) × 100,000 × 0.0001 = 20 pips × $10 = $200 profit
```

**Percentage P&L:**
```
P&L % = (P&L / Initial Investment) × 100
```

**Unrealized vs Realized P&L:**
- **Unrealized**: Current profit/loss while trade is open
- **Realized**: Final profit/loss after closing trade

### Editing Trade Parameters

**When to Edit:**
- **Move SL to Break-even**: When trade is 50% to TP
- **Trail Stop Loss**: Lock in profits as price moves
- **Adjust TP**: If market shows extended movement potential
- **Reduce Size**: Take partial profits

**Best Practices:**
- Never remove stop losses
- Don't widen stop loss on losing trades
